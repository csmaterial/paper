## 表示获得关注（常用于Abstract, Introduction等需要开篇的地方）

- In the past 10 years, ***considerable attention has been paid*** to perovskite materials fallingwithin the classification La1−xSrxMO3(where M is a transition metal) as catalysts for oxygen reduction.

- Among them, Mn-based oxides ***have attracted extensive interest because of*** low cost, highabundance, environmental friendliness and considerable activity.

- Rechargeable magnesium batteries ***have lately received great attention*** for large-scale energy storage systems due to their high volumetric capacities, low materials cost, and safe characteristic.

## 表示本领域目前出现的困境 （常用于Abstract, Introduction等处，尤其是在自己的新idea出现之前的地方） 所谓革命尚未成功，同志们仍需努力

- However, rechargeable Mg–air batteries with reversible oxygen reduction and evolutionreactions ***are facing challenges and it is worthwhile devoting much effort*** to this.
- As can be seen, the development of cathode materials convenient for rechargeable Mgbatteries ***remains an ongoing challenge*** due to strict requirements for the intercalation compound that ensures fast Mg 2+ ion transport in combination with a high operating voltage.
- Theoretical and experimental investigations on new cathode materials such as V2O5, MoS2, Li4Ti5O12, and MnO2 have demonstrated promising results, but it is generally agreed that a high-voltage high-capacity cathode with fast Mg2+ intercalation kinetics ***has yet to be identified.***
- Although some encouraging progress have been made, developing appropriate electrode materials with high capacity and good reversibility ***is less successful and still require further research***.

## 引进一个新事物，新材料，新方法 （常用于Introduction强调自己研究的重要性）

- ***Among*** the various NASICON compounds, NVP ***has emerged as an interesting candidate*** because of its impressive energy density.
- NaFePO4, ***unlike*** its celebrated lithium analogue olivine type LiFePO4, crystallized in the more thermodynamically stable maricite structure, ...
- Hence, ***it is no surprise*** that similar NaMO2 compounds ***have been targeted as*** Na intercalation electrodes.

## 引出自己做的工作
- Although there has been extensive research devoted to community discovery, most of it is restricted to single-relational networks.However, focus has been shifted to multi-relational networks in the recent years.
- 虽然已经有广泛的研究致力于社区发现，但大部分局限于单一关系网络。然而，近年来焦点已经转移到多关系网络。

- There are two important factors that drive these successful applications: usage of effective (statistical) models that capture the complex data dependencies and scalable learning systems that learn the model of interest from large datasets.
- 推动这些成功应用的因素有两个：使用捕获复杂数据依赖关系的有效（统计）模型和可从大型数据集中学习感兴趣模型的可扩展学习系统。
