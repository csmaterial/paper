表示一般好的，可用acceptable

The only exception was perhaps Chevrel phases (Mo6X8 , X = S, Se), which show ***acceptable*** intercalation kinetics and cycling stability for practical applications.

A ***surprisingly*** high-rate capability (170 mAh g-1 at 20 Ag-1) and ***unprecedented*** long-term cyclability (~90% capacity retention for 20 000 cycles) has been obtained.

XXX, with the reduced consumption of Pt while still maintaining ***satisfactory*** catalytic activity and stability.

This is a ***noteworthy*** finding because mullite-based oxides are significantly less expensive and more abundant than platinum group metals and offer a ***promising*** alternative route for tackling the oxygen activation problems.

形容多的，巨大的

extensive, intensitve, considerable, tremendous

In the past 10 years, ***considerable*** attention has been paid to perovskite materials falling within the classification La1−xSrxMO3(where M is a transition metal) as catalysts for oxygen reduction.

Among them, Mn-based oxides have attracted ***extensive*** interest because of low cost, highabundance, environmental friendliness and considerable activity.

In recent years, theoretical and experimental investigations of novel cathode materials for MIBs have increased ***tremendously***.

2d-trees have ***numerous*** applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.
